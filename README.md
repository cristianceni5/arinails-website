## 📋 Project Overview
**Arinails Salon** is a static, responsive web application designed as a digital portfolio for a professional Nail Artist. The primary goal of the system is to showcase visual assets (work samples), build brand trust through testimonials, and drive user conversion via social media integration.

The architecture follows a **Brochureware** pattern, prioritizing low latency, high availability, and cross-device compatibility without the overhead of a server-side backend.

## 🚀 Deployment
The application is deployed on **Netlify** leveraging its CD (Continuous Deployment) pipeline.
